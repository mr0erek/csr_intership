Air Quality Research in Indian Cities: 2024
=======================================

This research document provides a detailed analysis of air quality in Surat, Gujarat, and other key Indian cities, including major urban centers (New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad) and cleaner cities in states with better air quality (Aizawl in Mizoram, Gangtok in Sikkim). The focus is on 2024 air quality data, particularly PM2.5 concentrations and Air Quality Index (AQI) levels, to support a case study on air quality prediction using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). The data is sourced from credible references, including scientific studies, news reports, and air quality monitoring platforms, ensuring a robust foundation for understanding urban air pollution in India.

1. Introduction
---------------
Air pollution is a significant challenge in Indian cities, affecting public health and the environment. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and carbon monoxide (CO) are key pollutants contributing to poor air quality. The Indian Air Quality Index (AQI) categorizes air quality from Good (0-50) to Severe (401-500), guiding public health responses. This research examines air quality in Surat, major cities with high to moderate pollution, and cleaner cities, highlighting the potential of AI/ML to predict and mitigate pollution.

2. Air Quality in Surat, Gujarat
-------------------------------
Surat, a major industrial hub in Gujarat known for its textile and diamond industries, faces moderate air quality challenges due to industrial emissions, vehicular traffic, and construction activities. Its coastal location and meteorological factors like rainfall help mitigate pollution to some extent.

- Annual Average AQI (2024): 112, classified as Moderate (101-200), indicating acceptable air quality but potential discomfort for sensitive groups.
- Annual Average PM2.5 (2023): 52 µg/m³, likely slightly lower in 2024 (~48-50 µg/m³) due to a national 7% decrease in PM2.5 levels. This exceeds the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline of 5 µg/m³ by nearly 10 times.
- Trends: Surat’s AQI improved by 1% from 2020 to 2025, with a 5% decrease from 2023 (AQI 118) to 2024 (AQI 112). December 2022 was the most polluted month (AQI 168), while July 2020 was the least polluted (AQI 33), reflecting seasonal variations influenced by monsoons.
- Achievements: Surat topped India’s air quality improvement rankings in 2024, with pollution reduction efforts like emissions trading schemes reducing PM2.5 by 20-30% in recent years.[](https://aqli.epic.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AQLI-2024-Report_India-View.pdf)[](https://www.aqi.in/us/dashboard/india)

3. Air Quality in Major Indian Cities
------------------------------------
Major urban centers like New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Hyderabad experience varying levels of air pollution, driven by dense populations, traffic, and industrial activities. Below is an analysis of their 2024 air quality:

- New Delhi (Delhi):
  - Annual Average PM2.5 (2024): 92.7 µg/m³, among the highest in India, exceeding WHO guidelines by over 18 times.
  - AQI Category: Severe (>300), posing significant health risks due to vehicular emissions, crop burning, and industrial activity.
  - Context: New Delhi is one of the world’s most polluted capitals, with PM2.5 levels exceeding WHO standards on most days.[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7417276/)

- Mumbai (Maharashtra):
  - Annual Average PM2.5 (2024): 27.1 µg/m³, within the Moderate AQI range (101-200).
  - Context: Coastal breezes and urban planning help, but traffic and construction contribute to pollution. Mumbai’s air is cleaner than New Delhi’s but still exceeds WHO guidelines.

- Chennai (Tamil Nadu):
  - Annual Average PM2.5 (2024): 23.6 µg/m³, also Moderate.
  - Context: Chennai has relatively better air quality among major cities, with fewer days exceeding Indian National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) due to its coastal location and lower industrial emissions.[](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7417276/)

- Hyderabad (Telangana):
  - Annual Average PM2.5 (2024): 32.8 µg/m³, Moderate.
  - Context: Hyderabad faces pollution from traffic and rapid urbanization, though its air is less polluted than New Delhi’s.

4. Cleaner Cities in Other States
--------------------------------
States like Mizoram and Sikkim host cities with significantly better air quality, driven by low industrial activity, dense forest cover, and favorable geography.

- Aizawl (Mizoram):
  - Annual Average PM2.5 (2024): 13.8 µg/m³, among India’s lowest.
  - AQI Category: Good to Satisfactory (0-100), suitable for all activities.
  - Context: Aizawl benefits from hilly terrain and minimal industrial emissions, making it one of India’s cleanest cities.[](https://cpcb.nic.in/aqi-bulletin-3/)

- Gangtok (Sikkim):
  - Annual Average PM2.5 (2024): 13.8 µg/m³, tied with Aizawl as India’s least polluted.
  - AQI Category: Good to Satisfactory.
  - Context: High altitude and low population density contribute to clean air, ranking Gangtok among the least polluted in Central and South Asia.

6. AI/ML Applications for Air Quality Prediction
----------------------------------------------
AI and machine learning are powerful tools for predicting air quality, enabling proactive measures to reduce pollution. Key applications include:

- Data Inputs: Datasets include PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, traffic volume, and weather parameters (temperature, humidity, wind speed) over 2022–2024.
- Algorithms:
  - Ensemble Methods: Catboost and Random Forest excel at capturing non-linear relationships, with Catboost achieving R² values up to 0.9998 in similar studies.
  - Deep Learning: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models handle time series data, ideal for 24-hour AQI predictions.
  - Hybrid Models: Combine ARIMA for linear trends with neural networks for complex patterns.
- Feature Importance: PM2.5, NO2, traffic volume, and wind speed are consistently identified as key predictors, with PM2.5 being the most significant due to its health impacts.
- Evaluation Metrics: Models are assessed using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R²) to ensure accurate predictions.

Example: In Delhi, AI models predicted AQI with a 24-hour lead time, integrating traffic and weather data to issue public health warnings, a strategy applicable to Surat.[](https://www.iqair.com/us/india?srsltid=AfmBOooz7zfzU7KVKFl0ElA0SjMy1lnd_EvRgCo2lP4YeZb8Iyk6F5Co)

7. Key Findings
---------------
- Surat’s Air Quality: Moderate AQI (112) and PM2.5 (~52 µg/m³ in 2023) indicate ongoing challenges but notable improvements, with a 20-30% pollution reduction due to local initiatives like emissions trading.
- Major Cities: New Delhi faces severe pollution (PM2.5 92.7 µg/m³), while Mumbai, Chennai, and Hyderabad have moderate levels (23.6–32.8 µg/m³), all exceeding WHO guidelines.
- Cleaner Cities: Aizawl and Gangtok (PM2.5 13.8 µg/m³) provide benchmarks for clean air, driven by low emissions and natural factors.
- Seasonal Trends: Pollution peaks in winter (October–December) due to temperature inversions and crop burning, while monsoons (June–August) improve air quality.
- National Context: India’s average PM2.5 in 2024 was 50.6 µg/m³, a 7% improvement from 2023, but no city meets WHO’s 5 µg/m³ guideline.[](https://aqli.epic.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/India-FactSheet_2024.pdf)

8. Implications for AI/ML Case Study
-----------------------------------
This research supports the development of AI/ML models for air quality prediction in urban India:

- Model Development: Use Catboost or LSTM to predict 24-hour AQI in Surat, leveraging PM2.5, NO2, and weather data. Models can be validated using cleaner cities like Aizawl.
- Traffic Integration: Predictions can guide traffic management in Surat and New Delhi, such as adjusting signals or implementing low-emission zones to reduce congestion-related emissions.
- Developing Countries: AI offers cost-effective solutions for India, interpolating sparse sensor data and identifying pollution sources, though challenges include data access and expertise.

9. Conclusion
-------------
Surat’s moderate air quality (AQI 112, PM2.5 ~52 µg/m³) reflects progress but ongoing challenges, contrasting with severe pollution in New Delhi (PM2.5 92.7 µg/m³) and moderate levels in Mumbai, Chennai, and Hyderabad. Cleaner cities like Aizawl and Gangtok (PM2.5 13.8 µg/m³) highlight the impact of low emissions and geography. AI/ML models, using PM2.5, traffic, and weather data, can predict AQI, support traffic management, and enable cost-effective pollution control in India, aligning with sustainability goals.
